## Design Decisions

- **Used React with Tailwind CSS v4:** Tailwind's utility-first classes made styling fast, consistent, and responsive without writing separate CSS files.

- **Chose Vite:** Vite provided super fast builds and hot reloads, which made the development process smoother.

- **Dark Mode Support:** Leveraged Tailwind's built-in dark mode utilities to enable easy theme toggling and improve user experience.

- **Netlify Deployment:** Netlify was selected for its simplicity and free hosting options, allowing quick and easy deployment.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Organizing Tailwind Styles:** Keeping utility classes clean and reusable was challenging, especially when dealing with responsiveness and dark mode.

2. **Component Structure:** Building reusable and scalable React components alongside Tailwind styling required careful planning.

3. **Charts and Graphs:** Integrating and customizing Recharts components to display dynamic data clearly and interactively was challenging but crucial for meaningful visualization.
